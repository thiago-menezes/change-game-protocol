# Gym / Fitness

## What I Will Achieve
- Build bigger arms as initial visible progress
- Gradually expand workout routine to full body
- Establish sustainable gym habit using building-level progression
- Combine workouts with English study for efficiency

## Description
Progressive fitness strategy using the condominium gym. Start with arms to see quick results and build motivation, then gradually add muscle groups to create a complete routine without overwhelming commitment.

### Core Concept
- **Strategy**: Progressive muscle group addition
- **Starting focus**: Arms (biceps/triceps) for visible quick wins
- **Approach**: Light routine, not overly intense
- **Efficiency**: Combine with English listening practice during workouts
- **Priority**: Medium - health and motivation building

### Progression Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Arms only - build visible results and habit
2. **Phase 2**: Arms + Chest - maintain arms, add chest
3. **Phase 3**: Arms + Chest + Back - expand upper body
4. **Phase 4**: Full body - add legs and complete routine

### Multi-tasking Opportunity
- Listen to English podcasts/lessons during workouts
- Practice English shadowing between sets
- Combine fitness and language learning goals
