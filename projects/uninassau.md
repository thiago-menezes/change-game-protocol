# Uninassau

Priority: **CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE REVENUE**

## Financial Impact
- **Purpose**: Generate fast cash for daughter's pension + Brazil travel
- **Urgency**: HIGHEST - This is your survival revenue
- **Timeline**: POC must ship THIS WEEK

## What I Will Deliver
- Complete POC (Proof of Concept)
- Functional demonstration of the solution
- Delivery package ready for client approval
- Payment secured

## Description
[AWAITING DETAILS - What exactly is Uninassau? Education platform? Service? Product?]

**REQUIRED INFORMATION TO PROCEED:**
- What is the product/service?
- Who is the client?
- What does the POC need to demonstrate?
- What is the payment amount?
- What is the deadline?

## Current Status
- **Stage**: Need to create POC
- **Blocker**: Insufficient details about requirements
- **Next Action**: Define POC scope and deliverables

## Tasks to Deliver the Target

### Discovery (DO TODAY)
- [ ] **Define POC scope** - What must the POC demonstrate?
- [ ] **List all deliverables** - What files/features/functions must be completed?
- [ ] **Set deadline** - When is the POC due?
- [ ] **Confirm payment** - How much and when?
- [ ] **Identify blockers** - What could prevent completion?

### Execution (START IMMEDIATELY AFTER DISCOVERY)
- [ ] Break POC into 3-5 executable tasks
- [ ] Complete Task 1
- [ ] Complete Task 2
- [ ] Complete Task 3
- [ ] Complete Task 4 (if applicable)
- [ ] Complete Task 5 (if applicable)

### Delivery
- [ ] Final POC review and testing
- [ ] Package deliverables for client
- [ ] Submit POC to client
- [ ] Confirm payment received
- [ ] Invoice if needed

## Revenue-First Questions
1. **What is blocking the POC from starting TODAY?**
2. **Can any part of the POC be delivered in the next 4 hours?**
3. **What is the minimum viable POC that secures payment?**

## Execution Rules
- NO other projects until Uninassau POC ships
- Work in 90-minute blocks, then 10-minute break
- Report progress every 4 hours
- If stuck >1 hour on anything, escalate immediately

## Decision Point
**If POC cannot be clearly defined or started within 24 hours:**
- STOP and get clarity from client
- Do NOT proceed with fuzzy requirements
- Confirm payment terms before major work starts
