- [ ] Prepare presentation for Vinícius meeting

## Timeline & Milestones

**Meeting Date**: October 23, 2025 (today)
**POC Deadline**: Monday, October 28, 2025 (5 days)

### Key Milestones
- **Friday Oct 25**: Kake interview (PRIORITY - do NOT skip this)
- **Weekend (Oct 26-27)**: Primary POC development time
- **Sunday Oct 27 EOD**: POC must be 90% complete for final polish
- **Monday Oct 28 AM**: Final review, prepare presentation
- **Monday Oct 28**: Meeting with Vinícius to present POC

## Execution Strategy (5-Day Sprint)

### TODAY (Oct 23 - Evening)
- **6 hours**: Kake interview prep (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **2 hours**: Uninassau POC planning + framework setup

### TOMORROW (Oct 24 - Post-Interview)
**IF interview goes well:**
- **Morning**: Follow-up on interview
- **Afternoon/Evening**: Strapi setup + Design System research

### WEEKEND (Oct 26-27 - CORE DEVELOPMENT)
- **Saturday**: CMS + Static site framework + Design tokens
- **Sunday**: Course pages (PLP/PDP) + Navigation + Final polish

### MONDAY (Oct 28 - DELIVERY)
- **Morning**: Final testing + presentation prep
- **Meeting time**: Present POC to Vinícius

## Execution Rules
- Kake interview takes priority Friday morning
- POC development happens AFTER interview
- Weekend = focused Uninassau sprint (12+ hour days)
- 90-minute work blocks, 10-minute breaks
- Coordinate with Thales for Figma access
- Contact Thales Sunday evening for Monday meeting time

## Technical Decisions Made
✅ **CMS**: Strapi (own CMS, not external API dependency)
✅ **Architecture**: Static site generation (data injected at build time)
✅ **Design System**: Resapha (multi-university theming)
✅ **Speed**: 100% static, no runtime API calls
✅ **Scope**: Homepage + Course listing + Course details + Navigation

## Minimum Viable POC
To secure the project, the POC must demonstrate:
1. **CMS works**: Show content management in Strapi
2. **Design System works**: Show theming for different universities
3. **Static generation works**: Show fast, static pages
4. **Navigation works**: Click through homepage → course list → course detail
5. **Professional presentation**: Clean, functional, fast

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Design delays from Thales
  - **Mitigation**: Start with placeholder design, integrate Resapha tokens later
- **Risk**: Strapi learning curve
  - **Mitigation**: Use Strapi quick start, focus on basic content types only
- **Risk**: Time constraint (5 days with interview Friday)
  - **Mitigation**: Weekend sprint, Kake interview is still priority
- **Risk**: Scope creep
  - **Mitigation**: Stick to minimum viable POC, note "future enhancements"
