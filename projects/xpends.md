- Landing page with branding
- Social media presence (Instagram and Facebook)
- Complete personal finance management platform

## Description
Xpends is a personal finance application designed to help users control expenses, organize finances, and manage investments using an envelope budgeting methodology.

### Core Concept
- **Envelope-based budgeting**: Each month is organized into categories (envelopes), with each category having a specific budget
- **Monthly planning**: Users can plan spending before the month begins
- **Month-to-month view**: Primary focus on current month view, with ability to configure categories per month
- **Category management**: Categories can be fixed or customized monthly, automatically carrying over from previous month
- **Expense tracking**: Each expense must be assigned to a category
