# PRIORITY EXECUTION PLAN
**Updated:** 2025-10-23

## BRUTAL TRUTH

You have 6 projects. Only 2 matter THIS WEEK.

Stop spreading yourself thin. Revenue comes from COMPLETED work, not active projects.

---

## THE NEW GAME PLAN

### TIER 1: SURVIVAL REVENUE (DO FIRST)
**These pay your bills. Everything else waits.**

#### 1. KAKE INTERVIEW - TOMORROW
- **Impact**: Steady income = financial stability
- **Status**: Interview scheduled for tomorrow
- **Time Investment**: 6 hours prep TODAY, then interview tomorrow
- **Action**: Complete ALL items in `projects/kake-interview.md` by end of today
- **Success**: Secure job offer or advance to next round
- **File**: `projects/kake-interview.md`

#### 2. UNINASSAU POC - THIS WEEK
- **Impact**: Fast cash for daughter's pension + Brazil travel
- **Status**: Needs POC created
- **Time Investment**: TBD (awaiting scope definition)
- **Action**: Define POC requirements TODAY, ship by end of week
- **Success**: POC delivered, payment secured
- **File**: `projects/uninassau.md`
- **BLOCKER**: You didn't provide details on what Uninassau is or what the POC needs to be. FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY.

---

### TIER 2: ACTIVE REVENUE PIPELINE (30 DAYS)
**Work on these ONLY after Tier 1 is handled each day.**

- **Time Allocation**: 2-3 hours per day AFTER Tier 1 complete
- **File**: `projects/aico.md`

---

### TIER 3: FOUNDATION BUILDING (BACKGROUND MODE)
**These get leftover time ONLY. No new development until Tier 1 + 2 are shipping.**

#### 4. T8 PRO
- **Status**: Creating social media posts
- **Time Allocation**: 1 hour per day MAX, or batch on weekends
- **Action**: Create 7-day content calendar, then automate/schedule

### TIER 4: MAINTENANCE ONLY
**No active development. Sales and partnerships only.**

## EXECUTION RULES

### Non-Negotiable
1. **ONE project at a time**. No task switching within work blocks.
2. **Tier 1 before Tier 2**. Always. No exceptions.
3. **Ship, don't polish**. Done is better than perfect.
4. **90-minute max blocks**. Then 10-minute break. (ADHD protocol)
5. **Daily check-in**: What did you SHIP today? (Not worked on - SHIPPED)

### Project Switching Protocol
- You may ONLY switch to a lower-tier project if:
  1. Current project is blocked (waiting on client/external dependency)
  2. You've hit your daily time allocation for that tier
  3. You've completed the day's deliverable

### What "SHIPPED" Means
- **Kake**: Interview completed, thank you email sent
- **Uninassau**: POC deployed and sent to client
- **Aico**: Translation document completed and reviewed
- **T8/Retouch**: 7 posts created, scheduled, and published
- **iRoddas**: Sales page live OR 5 dealerships contacted

---

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS YOU MUST ANSWER

### About Uninassau (URGENT)
1. What exactly is Uninassau? (Education? Platform? Service?)
2. What must the POC demonstrate?
3. Who is the client/decision maker?
4. When is the POC deadline?
5. What is the payment amount and terms?
6. What are you blocked on right now?

**Without these answers, you CANNOT execute on your #1 financial priority.**

---

## DECISION MATRIX

When you're unsure what to work on, ask:

1. **Does this pay bills THIS WEEK?** → YES = Do it now (Tier 1)
2. **Does this pay bills THIS MONTH?** → YES = After Tier 1 (Tier 2)
3. **Is this building future revenue?** → YES = Leftover time only (Tier 3)
4. **Is this already complete/viable?** → YES = Sales mode, not dev mode (Tier 4)
5. **None of the above?** → KILL IT. You don't have bandwidth.

---

## WHAT TO STOP DOING

❌ **Stop**: Working on 6 projects simultaneously
✅ **Start**: Working on 2 projects intensely, 4 projects minimally

❌ **Stop**: Saying "I'm working on..."
✅ **Start**: Saying "I shipped..."

❌ **Stop**: Creating social media posts daily
✅ **Start**: Batch-creating 7-14 posts, schedule them, move on

❌ **Stop**: Building new features for iRoddas
✅ **Start**: Selling the MVP that already exists

❌ **Stop**: Translating materials slowly
✅ **Start**: Finish Aico translation in 2 focused days

## NEXT ACTIONS (DO NOW)

1. ✅ Review this document
2. ⏳ **Define Uninassau POC scope** (what is it? what's required?)
3. ⏳ **Start Kake interview prep** (6 hours today)
4. ⏳ **Update daily routine** with new priorities
5. ⏳ **Set tomorrow's alarms** for interview

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**You have 2 immediate revenue opportunities:**
1. Kake = steady income
2. Uninassau = fast cash

**Everything else is secondary.**

Focus wins. Scattered attention loses.
