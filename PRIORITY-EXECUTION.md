# PRIORITY EXECUTION PLAN
**Updated:** 2025-10-23

## BRUTAL TRUTH

You have 6 projects. Only 2 matter THIS WEEK.

Stop spreading yourself thin. Revenue comes from COMPLETED work, not active projects.

## THE NEW GAME PLAN

**These pay your bills. Everything else waits.**

## EXECUTION RULES

### Non-Negotiable
1. **ONE project at a time**. No task switching within work blocks.
2. **Tier 1 before Tier 2**. Always. No exceptions.
3. **Ship, don't polish**. Done is better than perfect.
4. **90-minute max blocks**. Then 10-minute break. (ADHD protocol)
5. **Daily check-in**: What did you SHIP today? (Not worked on - SHIPPED)

### Project Switching Protocol
- You may ONLY switch to a lower-tier project if:
  1. Current project is blocked (waiting on client/external dependency)
  2. You've hit your daily time allocation for that tier
  3. You've completed the day's deliverable

### What "SHIPPED" Means
- **Kake**: Interview completed, thank you email sent
- **Uninassau**: POC deployed and sent to client
- **Aico**: Translation document completed and reviewed
- **T8/Retouch**: 7 posts created, scheduled, and published
- **iRoddas**: Sales page live OR 5 dealerships contacted

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS - ANSWERED ✅

### About Uninassau
1. ✅ What exactly is Uninassau? **University website for Ser Educacional Group**
2. ✅ What must the POC demonstrate? **CMS + Design System + Course pages + Navigation**
3. ✅ Who is the client/decision maker? **Vinícius (working with designer Thales Guilherme)**
4. ✅ When is the POC deadline? **Monday, October 28, 2025 (5 days from now)**
5. ❓ What is the payment amount and terms? **Pending - Thales confirming with Vinícius**
6. ✅ What are you blocked on right now? **NOTHING - Execute immediately**

### Immediate Action Items
- [ ] Get Figma access from Thales (for design tokens)
- [ ] Confirm Monday meeting time with Thales/Vinícius
- [ ] Choose static site framework (Next.js recommended)
- [ ] Set up Strapi locally Friday afternoon

---

## DECISION MATRIX

When you're unsure what to work on, ask:

1. **Does this pay bills THIS WEEK?** → YES = Do it now (Tier 1)
2. **Does this pay bills THIS MONTH?** → YES = After Tier 1 (Tier 2)
3. **Is this building future revenue?** → YES = Leftover time only (Tier 3)
4. **Is this already complete/viable?** → YES = Sales mode, not dev mode (Tier 4)
5. **None of the above?** → KILL IT. You don't have bandwidth.

---

## WHAT TO STOP DOING

❌ **Stop**: Working on 6 projects simultaneously
✅ **Start**: Working on 2 projects intensely, 4 projects minimally

❌ **Stop**: Saying "I'm working on..."
✅ **Start**: Saying "I shipped..."

❌ **Stop**: Creating social media posts daily
✅ **Start**: Batch-creating 7-14 posts, schedule them, move on

❌ **Stop**: Building new features for iRoddas
✅ **Start**: Selling the MVP that already exists

❌ **Stop**: Translating materials slowly
✅ **Start**: Finish Aico translation in 2 focused days
