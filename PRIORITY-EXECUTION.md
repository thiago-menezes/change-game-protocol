# PRIORITY EXECUTION PLAN

## EXECUTION RULES

### Non-Negotiable
1. **ONE project at a time**. No task switching within work blocks.
2. **Tier 1 before Tier 2**. Always. No exceptions.
3. **Ship, don't polish**. Done is better than perfect.
4. **90-minute max blocks**. Then 10-minute break. (ADHD protocol)
5. **Daily check-in**: What did you SHIP today? (Not worked on - SHIPPED)

### Project Switching Protocol
- You may ONLY switch to a lower-tier project if:
  1. Current project is blocked (waiting on client/external dependency)
  2. You've hit your daily time allocation for that tier
  3. You've completed the day's deliverable

### What "SHIPPED" Means
- **Kake**: Interview completed, thank you email sent
- **Uninassau**: POC deployed and sent to client
- **Aico**: Translation document completed and reviewed
- **T8/Retouch**: 7 posts created, scheduled, and published
- **iRoddas**: Sales page live OR 5 dealerships contacted

## DECISION MATRIX

When you're unsure what to work on, ask:

1. **Does this pay bills THIS WEEK?** ‚Üí YES = Do it now (Tier 1)
2. **Does this pay bills THIS MONTH?** ‚Üí YES = After Tier 1 (Tier 2)
3. **Is this building future revenue?** ‚Üí YES = Leftover time only (Tier 3)
4. **Is this already complete/viable?** ‚Üí YES = Sales mode, not dev mode (Tier 4)
5. **None of the above?** ‚Üí KILL IT. You don't have bandwidth.
